exec scripts
//exec my_cfg_name // if you would like to overwrite settings each time the game starts.

//
//> The game stores its setting in the quake3.cfg.
//
//> Executing a config from another mod OR game (e.g., QLive) is an extraordinarily bad idea. You can copy-paste general binds, though.
//
//> Never do /writeconfig autoexec. Use /writeconfig my_cfg_name instead.
//
//> If you enjoy tinkering with your config, edit my.cfg.
//
//> Use /cvar_trim to clean your quake3.cfg from non-existent variables, it will also remove all the scripts so keep them in a separate file, scripts.cfg e.g..
